# Interactive Data Structures Visualization

Interactive Data Structures Visualization is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize and interact with commonly used data structures such as Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks. The project provides a user-friendly interface to perform operations on these data structures in real-time, offering a visual representation of their state.

## Features

- **Linked List Visualization:** Users can add nodes to the linked list by entering values and clicking the "Add Node" button. The visualization dynamically updates to display the added nodes. Nodes can also be removed by entering their values and clicking the "Remove Node" button.

- **Queue Visualization:** Users can enqueue elements to the queue by entering values and clicking the "Enqueue" button. The visualization dynamically updates to display the enqueued elements. Elements can be dequeued by clicking the "Dequeue" button, removing the first element from the queue.

- **Stack Visualization:** Users can push elements onto the stack by entering values and clicking the "Push" button. The visualization dynamically updates to display the pushed elements. Elements can be popped from the stack by clicking the "Pop" button, removing the topmost element from the stack.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Interactive Data Structures Visualization project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project folder.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Once the project is running in your web browser, you will see the interactive interface with options for Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks.

2. Choose the data structure you want to interact with by selecting the corresponding option.

3. For Linked Lists:
- To add a node, enter a value in the "Enter node value" input field and click the "Add Node" button.
- To remove a node, enter its value in the "Enter node value" input field and click the "Remove Node" button.

4. For Queues:
- To enqueue an element, enter a value in the "Enter element value" input field and click the "Enqueue" button.
- To dequeue an element, click the "Dequeue" button.

5. For Stacks:
- To push an element, enter a value in the "Enter element value" input field and click the "Push" button.
- To pop an element, click the "Pop" button.

6. The visualization will update in real-time to reflect the changes made to the data structures.

## Technologies Used

The Interactive Data Structures Visualization project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements and layout.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the data structures, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the visualizations.
